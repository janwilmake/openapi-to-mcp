The worker automatically discovers OpenAPI specs, builds proper MCP configurations, and proxies requests with full parameter handling and authentication support!

To test, run `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector` and use any API as MCP by passing url https://mcp.openapisearch.com/{hostname}/mcp

Please note, the openapi can provide a filter to the tools, prompts, and resources available by providing operations with ids `tools/list`, `prompts/list` and `resources/list`.
